        <p>These plastic pieces tremendously enhance the slatplanner experience. You simply print out 
activity stickers and place them onto these plastic note pieces. These are designed to fit into standard 3-inch slat boards, which are available 
everywhere. Using a slat wall for planning allows you to easily slide groups of activities back and forth, while providing a mechanical, 
rather than sticky, connection. These pieces also to snap to each other, to represent durations or set strings of activities. This system 
creates a neat, clean, visual work of art in your office environment, where all activities line up in perfect rows.
