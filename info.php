    <div class="cont text-center">
    	<p>The slatplanner system was designed to easily digitize traditional “sticky-note” plans, while not taking away from the physical, 
collaborative experience of wall planning. It enables wall plans to be uploaded directly into various pieces of scheduling 
software for enhanced collaboration, comparison.

	<div class="cont text-center">
		<p>You start by generating printable “sticky notes” on the slatplanner webpage. Next, you arrange these physical 
“sticky notes” into a wall schedule and scan them with this app. Now, you can easily preview and upload these activities to your 
scheduling platform of choice, straight from your phone.</p>
